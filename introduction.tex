\section{Background}

The Water Technologies department at Baxter develops water systems for use in mixing fluid for dialysis treatments. The water quality is important in order not to harm the patients when using the final product. The water systems used for water purification are using the reverse osmosis (RO) method as the first stage in the purification process. It remove impurities, as salt and inorganic molecules from the water\cite{Dow}.\\
\\
In a RO-system the feed water is pressurized by a pump and forced through the RO-membrane to overcome the osmotic pressure. The RO-membrane is a semi-permeable membrane and let water passes freely true the membrane creating a purified product stream. \\
\\
The pump in the current system has two purposes, creating a pressure to overcome the osmotic pressure and creating a flow on the reject side of the RO-membrane to prevent aggregation of impurities on the membrane surface.\\


\section{Motivation}
By using two pumps instead of one in the RO-system it will be possible to control the pressure on the membrane and the flow on the reject side independently and thus it might be possible to optimize the performance of the RO-system, focusing on reducing impurities, energy consumtion and water consumption. \\
\\
Currently there is a simulink model of the RO-membrane from an earlier masters thesis. However, this model does not include the temperatue dependencies of the membrane and therefor these dependancies should be investigated and added to the model. 
\section{Goal}
The purpose of this masters thesis is to evaluate the feasibility of replacing the main RO-pump with two pumps, one for controlling the flow through the membrane and one for controlling the pressure. The positioning of the pumps, membrane and other component sould be investigated and tested. \\
\\
The temperature dependencies of the RO-membrane should be added into the current simscape model.
\\
To achieve good performance it will be necessary to design a realistic model of the system, once the model has been designed and tested a control algorithm is to be developed and implementet on a physical test setup. This algorithm, should be able to control the flow and pressure over the RO-membrane to maximize the performance of the membrane while minimizing waste water and energy consumtion. \\


\subsection{Framing of questions}
\label{framing}
\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand\labelitemi{-}
   \item Is it possible to upgrade the RO-membrane model to include temperature dependencies?
   \item Is it possible to control the system with two pumps instead of one, which is used today?
   \item Is it possible to design a control algorithm using two pumps that will optimize the performance of the membrane while reducing waste water, power and possibly noise? (In comparison with the current system).   
\end{itemize}


\section{Method}

In order to investigate the performance of the current system and to compare it with the new model following steps will be evaluated:

\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand\labelitemi{-}
    \item Research on the RO-membrane that is implemented in the system.
    \item Research on previous work on the field.
    \item Modelling of the system to identify suitable component properties and design of the flow path.
    \item Design of control algorithms.
    \item Implementation in a test rig to verify the performance of the system.
    \item Run tests to determine the performance.
    \item Improve if possible.
\end{itemize}
