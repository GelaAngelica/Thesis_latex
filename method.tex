\section{Flowchart investigation}
To obtain a system to run tests on some different flowcharts will be considered. The current pump will be replaced by two pumps. Following requirements will is desirable when obtaining a updated model of the flowchart:\\
\\
\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand\labelitemi{-}
\item Pressure drop over the membran is high
\item Desirable flow through membrane is high
\end{itemize}
The model shall contribute with following:\\
\\
\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand\labelitemi{-}
\item Fouling on the membrane is to be minimized
\item Temperature dependencies will be taken in concern
\item Waste water going through drain is minimized
\end{itemize}
