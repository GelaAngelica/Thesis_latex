\section{Simscape/Simulink}

Simscape is a graphical programming tool within the Matlab simulink environment designed to model and simulate physical systems. A model of the RO-membrane and the flow path was designed using simscape and the simulated system could then be controlled using a control algorithm running in Matlab.  The RO-membrane model encorporate separete mathematical models of the most important system dependencies, such as temperature  , flow, pressure and conductivity.  

The control system was implemented in simulink...
