Reverse osmosis is one of the most common water purification techniques and is used in applications ranging from salt water desalination plants to medical devices. Baxter is a company that developes medical devices and water purification devices that is used in medical applications. In this thesis a new flow path is investigated that replaces a single feed water pump with to independant pumps. The goal is to investihgate the advantages with this setup and to design a control application that is able to optimize the performance of the system for all operating conditions within the operating range. 

The second pump offers another degree of freedom which alows the pressurization and flow over the membrane to be independently controlled.
