\section{Flowchart investigation}
To obtain a system to run tests on some different flowcharts will be considered. The current pump will be replaced by two pumps. Following requirements will be desirable when obtaining a updated model of the flowchart:
\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand\labelitemi{-}
\item Pressure drop over the membran is high
\item Flow through membrane is high
\end{itemize}
The model shall contribute with following:
\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand\labelitemi{-}
\item Permeate conductivity is to be minimized
\item Fouling on the membrane is minimized
\item Temperature dependencies will be taken in concern
\item Waste water going through drain is minimized
\end{itemize}
