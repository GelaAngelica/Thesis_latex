\section{Mapping}
This work is a first step in investigating the possibility to optimize the performance of the membrane. It can be seen that there are great possibilities, but in order to achieve an optimum performance more mapping should to be done. The current algorithm will not be optimal from 5 to 20 $^{\circ}$C.  


\section{Membrane size}
As seen in the tests the permeate water quality is due to the flow and salt rejection rate. In order to design devices that will deliver as clean and purified water as possible it might be beneficial to use smaller membranes when lower permeate flow is needed. Today there are recirculation paths from permeate side back to tank where clean purified water is mixed with inlet water, which might not be neccssary if down scaling the membrane.
