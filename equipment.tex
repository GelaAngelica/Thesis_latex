\section{Simscape/Simulink}

Simscape is a graphical programming tool within the Matlab simulink environment designed to model and simulate physical systems. A model of the RO-membrane and the flow path was designed using simscape and the simulated system could then be controlled using a control algorithm running in Matlab.  The RO-membrane model encorporate separete mathematical models of the most important system dependencies, such as temperature  , flow, pressure and conductivity.  

The control system was implemented in simulink...

\section{Water Application Value Engine, WAVE} \label{WAVE}
Water Application Value Engine, WAVE, is a first modelling software program by Dow Water and Process Solutions. The program integrates three of the leading technologies - Ultrafiltration (UF), reverse osmosis(RO), and ion exchange(IX) into one comprehensive tool using a common interface. The program can be used to estimate the performance of UF, RO and IX technologies in water treatment systems. \cite{DOW}
