\section{Tests on current system}
In order to compare results of the current system and the updated system some test will be done on the current setup. To set up convenient test cases the WAVE software program described in \ref{WAVE} is used. Reasonable values for the test cases were set to:
\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand\labelitemi{ }
\item Temperature 5-45 $^\circ$C
\item Conductivity 70-2000 \SI{}{\micro\siemens}
\end{itemize}

\section{Flowchart investigation}
To obtain a system to run tests on some different flowcharts will be considered. The current pump will be replaced by two pumps. Following requirements will be desirable when obtaining a updated model of the flowchart:
\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand\labelitemi{-}
\item Pressure drop over the membran is high
\item Flow through membrane is high
\end{itemize}
The model shall contribute with the following:
\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand\labelitemi{-}
\item Permeate conductivity is minimized
\item Fouling on the membrane is minimized
\item Temperature dependencies will be taken in concern
\item Waste water going through drain is minimized
\end{itemize}
