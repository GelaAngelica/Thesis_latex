\section{Semi-permeable membrane}
A membrane is defined as a barrier between two homogeneous phases. The process is a continuos steady-state operation consisting three streams: feed, permeate and reject. Main concern in the process boundary is the semipermeable barrier that selectively allows the passage of some components but not others. \cite{Singh}

\section{Osmosis}
The osmosis process occurs when two solutions of different chemical concentration are separated by a semi-permeable membrane. The two different solutions will try to reach equilibrium. The solution with less concentration will have a natural tendency to migrate through the membrane over to the side with higher concentration.  
Osmosis is a naturally occurring phenomenon and one of the most important processes in nature. The pressure that occurs is called the osmotic pressure. The phenomenon can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:osmosis}

\section{Reverse osmosis}
The reverse osmosis(RO) process is the reverse process of the osmosis. When pressure is applied to a semipermeable membrane, the water molecules are forced through the semipermeable membrane and the contaminants are not allowed true. The amount of pressure required depends on the salt concentration of the water. In order to gain reverse osmosis the pressure applied must be greater than the osmosis pressure. The membrane employs cross filtration rather than standard filtration. With cross filtration, the solution passes through the filter with two outlets. One solution passes true the membrane and is called permeate and is the filtered solution. The other solution can be drained or be fed back into the filtering system. The contaminants build up att the surface area and it is of great importance to try to sweep them away and hold the surface clean. If the contaminants builds up the performance of the membrane will decrease, and cleaning with chemicals or heat water might be necessary\cite{Puretech}. The phenomenon of reverse osmosis can be seen in \ref{fig:ReverseOsmosis}.

In order to obtain good performace over the RO membrane there are some parameters that should be taken in consideration when designing a RO system. These are:

\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand\labelitemi{-}
\item Feed pressure
\item Permeate pressure
\item Concentrate pressure
\item Feed conductivity
\item Permeate conductivity
\item Feed flow
\item Permeate flow
\item Temperature
\end{itemize}

To measure the performance of the membrane there are some important parameters:

\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand\labelitemi{-}
\item Salt rejection (\%)
\item Salt passage (\%)
\item Recovery (\%)
\item Concentration factor 
\item Flux
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Definitions}

\[ \textbf{Salt Rejection \%} = \frac{C_f - C_p}{C_f} 100\]  \\ 
\[ \textbf{Salt passage \%} = (1 - Salt  Rejection  \% )\] 
\[ \textbf{Recovery \%} = \frac{Permeate Flow rate (gpm)}{Feed Flow rate (gpm)} 100\]
\[ \textbf{Concentration Factor} = \frac{1}{1-Recovery \%} \]
\[ \textbf{Flux } = \frac{gpm permeate * 1,440 min/day }{nbrOf ROelements* \sqrt{FootageOfEachRO}} 100\]


\subsection{Fouling}
Fouling occurs when contaminants accumulate on the surface of the membrane. The fouling contributes to a pressure drop that will decrease the performance of the membrane and cause less permeate flow. Fouling will happen eventually to some extent given the fine pore size of the membrane. A high reject flow and proper pretreatment will extend the operational time between cleaning procedures of the membrane\cite{Puretech}.
