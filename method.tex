\section{Tests on current system}
In order to compare results of the current system and the updated system some test will be done on the current setup. Reasonable values for the test cases were set to:
\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand\labelitemi{ }
\item Temperature 5-45 $^\circ$C
\item Conductivity 70-2000 \SI{}{\micro\siemens}
\end{itemize}

\section{Flowchart investigation}
To obtain a system to run tests on some different flowcharts will be considered. The current pump will be replaced by two pumps. Following requirements will be desirable when obtaining a updated model of the flowchart:
\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand\labelitemi{-}
\item Pressure drop over the membrane is high
\item Flow through membrane is high
\end{itemize}
The model shall contribute with the following:
\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand\labelitemi{-}
\item Permeate conductivity is minimized
\item Fouling on the membrane is minimized
\item Temperature dependencies will be taken in concern
\item Waste water going through drain is minimized
\end{itemize}



\section{Modeling}
Simscape software tool described in section \ref{Simscape} is used to do a physical modeling in order to achieve the characteristics of the membrane. Mathematical equations from the manufacturer of the membrane and physics of the solution-diffussion model described in section \ref(SD) is used and implemented.
