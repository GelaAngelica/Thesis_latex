\section{Test on current system}

\section{Flowchart investigation}
Two different setups for a comparing system to the current system were investigated, section \ref{Flowchart}, and one system, System 2 were chosen to be the comparing system. Both Systems were considered fulfilling most of the requirements, section \ref{framing}, for an updated version. Restrictions on the membrane, such as requirements on no back pressure on the membrane lead to the decision on chosing System 2 as a comparing system. 

The two comparing systems were set to:\\
