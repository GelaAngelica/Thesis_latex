\item [Inlet water:] The water that is pumped into the system from the tank.
\item [Feed water:] The pressurized water stream that i pushed into the feed inlet of the membrane.
\item [Permeate water:]  The purified water stream leaving the membrane as product water.
\item [Reject:] The brine water leaving the RO-module. The reaject water can either be recirculated or rejected through the drain valve.
\item [Drain:] The water wasted, e.g. water leaving the flow path through the drain valve.
\item [Recirculation loop:] Recirculation path from the reject stream of the RO-module into the feed stream.
\item [Membrane flux:] Flow through the surface of the membrane.
\item [Pressure:]  System pressure, measured in Bar.
\item [Flow:] Water flow in the flow path. Measured in ml/min.
\item [Conductivity:] The electrical conductivity of the water is used to determine the amount of dissolved salts in the fluid. Measured in uS/cm.
\item [RO:] Short for Reverse Osmosis
\item [Semi-permeable membrane:] Physical property of the membrane that describes how the membrane is able to let some substances permetate over the mebrane while blocking other substances.
